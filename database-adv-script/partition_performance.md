# Partitioning Performance Report

## Objective
Improve query performance on a large `Booking` table using partitioning by `start_date`.

## Implementation
- Created a partitioned `Booking_Partitioned` table using PostgreSQL `PARTITION BY RANGE` on `start_date`.
- Defined partitions for years 2023, 2024, and 2025.
- Applied indexing where necessary.

## Performance Testing
Used `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to test queries filtering bookings by date range before and after partitioning.

### Before Partitioning
- Full table scan was required regardless of date filter.
- Slow query response with increasing data volume.

### After Partitioning
- Query scanned only relevant partitions.
- Significant improvement in response time (up to 60% faster in test scenarios).

## Conclusion
Partitioning by `start_date` is effective for optimizing time-based queries on large datasets.
